# Classic-Wow.org

The project "Classic-WoW.org" is a small CMaNGOS based but closed source, german PvE server with lots of custom features, that calls itself blizzlike.

* 2x Rates (up to 4x rates on events)
* 2x Rates on professions
* Instant teleports at flight masters
* Teleports on boats and airship routes
* Class skills always on maximum (Lockpicking, Poisons, ...)
* Weaponskills always on maxium
* Skill reset costs at max. 50 silver
* Option to stop experience gain
* All flight paths (teleporters) turned on by default
* Option to create a PvP account
* Custom battleground queue techniques
* Tuned raid and instance bosses
* Command to change password ingame

However, most of these features can only be used while having an active premium account (~5$/Month). As I had the impression that most of the players there have such a premium membership, I decided to write an addon for them to make it easier to switch experience rates and such. Also because I got a free premium membership for providing this addon. :P

## Installation
1. Download **[Latest Version](https://github.com/shagu/Classic-Wow.org/archive/master.zip)**
2. Unpack the Zip file
3. Rename the folder "Classic-Wow.org-master" to "Classic-Wow.org"
4. Copy "Classic-Wow.org" into Wow-Directory\Interface\AddOns

The custom features that can be changed with this addon are the following:

* Select the desired experience gain (0x, 1x, 2x, Max)
* Turn on/off the instant teleports at flight masters
* Create PvP Account
* Change Passwort
* Restore per-character settings on login
